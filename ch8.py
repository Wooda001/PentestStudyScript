questions = ['Which method of attacking Wi-Fi networks occurs when an attacker creates a wireless access point with an ESSID identical to one to which an unwitting user intends to connect? As they negotiate a connection, users pass authentication information to this malicious access point, enabling attackers to recover victim device user traffic or access credentials. This attack frequently abuses the fact that wireless networks are typically presented in order of signal strength and can therefore benefit from high-gain wireless antennae or close physical proximityto a connecting client.\n\nA.
