A chief component of the assessment is focused on the security mindfulness of its employees, and includes a physical penetration test. You begin by waiting until late at night and stealing trash bags from the company’s dumpster, planning to rifle through the trash later looking for passwords or other sensitive information. You are also asked to run a phishing campaign and are given a selection of individuals who may be specifically targeted. When executing the campaign, you elect to use a text-based framework that can generate payloads, create malicious files, andsend e-mails as directed. During the physical penetration test phase, you are not only able to breach the perimeter while posing as a fire marshal on site to inspect sprinkler systems, but are able to identify an employee’s username and password by glancing over their shoulder as they type. \n \n The opening action of stealing trash to look for sensitive information that may be of use during a penetration test is an example of what?\n\nA.

As part of this engagement, they have requested that you attempt social engineering attacks on their employees. You are toldthat you may target any employees you wish, but that the client would like to see your target list before you execute the attack—and that they will not be providing any target e-mail addresses prior to your campaign. During your research, you identify several hundred e-mail addresses for employees of the organization,including several who are listed as members of a team that designs consumer-grade appliances, some who identify themselves as systems administrators, and a handful of corporate-level executive personnel. For your phishing attacks, you elect to create a landing page mimicking a commonly used web application and generate a payload that will compromise the user’s web browser, from which you can launch further attacks against the client’s network. \n \n Given the lack of information provided by the client about potential social engineering targets, which of the following tools would be the most time-efficient way to begin casing the target to identify critical information, automating tasks such as collecting names ofpersonnel or the corporate e-mail address schema?\n\nA.
